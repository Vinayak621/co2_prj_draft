      <h2>About Carbon Mitigation</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: justify;">Carbon mitigation is a web green infrastructure based application which is used to suggest methods and preventive measures to improve 
         reduce carbon emissions.Carbon emissions contribute to climate change by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to a rise in global temperatures. This has numerous negative impacts such as rising
          sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters, changes in precipitation patterns, and effects on biodiversity.
          Also contribute to air pollution, which can have negative health impacts such as respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer.
          When carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean, it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, which decreases the pH level of the ocean(ocean acidification).
          Along with these, carbon emissions also contribute to deforestation and water scarcity.
          These hazards make it crucial to reduce carbon emissions and transition to more sustainable energy sources in order to mitigate the negative impacts on the environment and human health.
          Through this project we have taken up the initiation  to implement
         green infrastructure to mitgate climate change impacts caused due to the hazardous effects of carbon emissions.
      The codes for this project can be checked in my <a href="https://github.com/Vinayak621/CarbonInf"

      <h2>DEFORESTATION</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a measure of the amount and health of vegetation in an area, based on the reflectance of visible 
        and near-infrared light. NDVI is calculated using satellite imagery and is widely used in ecological studies, agricultural monitoring, and land-use planning.

        Deforestation can have a significant impact on NDVI. When trees are removed from an area, the NDVI values decrease due to the loss of vegetation. 
        This decrease in NDVI can be used to monitor and measure the extent and severity of deforestation in a particular area. However, it's important to note that NDVI is not a perfect indicator 
        of deforestation, as it can also be affected by factors such as cloud cover, soil moisture, and atmospheric conditions.
        The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated using the reflectance values of two bands of light, typically the red (R) and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The NDVI formula is:

        NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R)
        
        The values for the NIR and R bands are typically measured by remote sensing instruments such as satellites, drones, or airborne sensors. These instruments measure the amount of sunlight reflected by the Earth's surface in different wavelengths or bands of light.
        
        To calculate NDVI from these measurements, the reflectance values for the NIR and R bands are first obtained. The reflectance values are then normalized to a range of -1 to 1 using the following formula:
        
        Normalized Reflectance = (Reflectance - Reflectance min) / (Reflectance max - Reflectance min).</p>

        <h2>About predictor</h2>
        <p class="about-content" style="text-align: justify;"> The planning, design, and implementation of natural and 
          semi-natural elements in urban areas to give ecological, social, and economic advantages
           constitute a key endeavour known as a "green infrastructure project." Parks, urban forests, green roofs, and water bodies
            are just a few examples of the different components that make up green infrastructure. Green infrastructure may improve air 
            and water quality, increase urban biodiversity, reduce the urban heat island effect, 
            and promote human health and well-being. By lowering carbon emissions, preparing for extreme weather, and boosting resilience, green infrastructure is a useful instrument for decreasing the effects of climate change.
             All things considered, a green infrastructure project is an essential part of sustainable urban development that 
          may help make cities more livable, resilient, and healthy for present and future generations.
          Collecting data on carbon emissions and determining the key factors that contribute to carbon emissions are the two steps of a project
           to reduce carbon emissions using the DecisionTreeClassifier classification ML algorithm. The model is trained using the random forest classification technique,
            and its performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. With the aid of this study, carbon emissions may be predicted and the main 
            causes of carbon emissions can be determined. The data produced by this research can be used to create plans to lower carbon emissions and lessen the effects of climate change.
             Overall, this effort is crucial for solving one of the most pressing global issues of our day and can help ensure that our planet has a sustainable future.
